#!/usr/bin/env bash
# a Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine itâ€™s
#+ executed on.

ifconfig | grep "inet" | cut -d ":" -f 2 | cut -d " " -f 2

#works by first running the ifconfig command, which will print a list of all
#the network interfaces on the system. Then, it uses the grep command to search
#the output of the ifconfig command for the string "inet". This will match all
#the lines that contain an IP address.
#The cut command is then used to extract the IP address from the output of the
#grep command. The first cut command uses the -d ":" option to split the output
#on the colon character. The second cut command uses the -d " " option to split
#the output on the space character.
#The final output of the script will be the IP address of the current
#network interface.
