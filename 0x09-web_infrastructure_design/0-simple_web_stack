### Server (8.8.8.8):

A server is a computer that stores and serves data to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
In this case, our server will host all the necessary components for the website.


### Domain Name (www.foobar.com):

The domain name is a human-readable address that maps to an IP address.
It provides a user-friendly way to access websites instead of using numerical IP addresses.



### DNS Record (www in www.foobar.com):

The DNS record "www" in www.foobar.com is a subdomain and typically represents the web server where your website is hosted.
It helps route requests to the appropriate server based on the subdomain used.



### Web Server (Nginx):

The web server (Nginx) handles HTTP requests from users' browsers.
It receives incoming requests and serves static content (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) directly.
For dynamic content, it forwards requests to the application server.



### Application Server:

The application server is responsible for processing dynamic requests.
It runs your application code (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby) to generate dynamic content.
It communicates with the database to fetch and update data as required.



### Application Files (Your Code Base):

Your application files contain the code and logic that define how your website functions.
These files are executed by the application server to generate dynamic web pages.



### Database (MySQL):

The database stores and manages structured data used by your website.
It allows for data retrieval, storage, and modification, providing content for dynamic web pages.



###User's Computer:

When a user wants to access www.foobar.com, they enter the URL in their web browser.
The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server (Nginx) via the internet.


###############Issues:##############

### Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

Since all components are hosted on a single server, any hardware or software failure could lead to downtime for the entire website.
To mitigate this, you could implement redundancy, such as load balancing across multiple servers.



###Downtime During Maintenance:

When you need to perform maintenance, like deploying new code or updating server configurations, the web server often needs to be restarted.
This can result in temporary downtime for users.
To minimize downtime, you can set up a redundant server and load balancer to route traffic to the active server during maintenance.



### Scalability Limitations:

This infrastructure may struggle to handle a significant increase in traffic.
Scaling horizontally (adding more servers) is challenging with this setup.
To address scalability, consider using load balancers and adding more application and database servers as needed.
